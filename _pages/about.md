I am a first year PhD student in Statistics and Computer Science at Bocconi University, Milan. I based my previous projects and studies on the field of Probability and Statistics Theory. 

I'm graduated in Mathematics at the University of Pavia. I attended the Erasmus Traineeship program to write my Master's Thesis abroad at the Heriot Watt University of Edinbrugh.
